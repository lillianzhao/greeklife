If the houses choose not to offer financial aid for any of the additional costs listed above, that is up to them (although a separate issue which should be discussed with them)--but also not an issue that any other house should compensate or lose a fair percentage of funds for. I do not believe social dues should be included in any determination of financial aid award from the ISC to a particular house because they vary so widely from house to house.Additionally, the change from Panhellenic Council to InterSorority Council, although in efforts to better the Greek system (and I see the potential, especially considering this is the first survey I've ever received from Panhell/ISC), was done so without a vote from houses who are at liberty to the governing body. Meaning that, although houses were consulted for their opinions, suggestions and concerns, the ISC was formed without a democratic approval process including the houses for which it governs. I would request that any changes to the ISC financial aid award policies are at the very least, fully explained and revised in collaborative process with the houses for which they apply to, before they are officially changed.",No,No,No,,6 or more,
